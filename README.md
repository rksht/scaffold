## A set of C++ utilities into the mix.

* Foundation library by Bitsquid plays a big part which resides in the top
  level.

* A scanner for tokenizing input.

* Some more allocators.

* Some more data structures.

Then there's more in submodules/ directory which contains third-party projects
I'm using.

(README is kind of in progress)
